# Monero Outreach MoneroDocs - MOM

MOM is a repository forked from the original [monerodocs/md](https://github.com/monerodocs/md.git) repository. [Monerodocs](https://monerodocs.org/) site, attempts to organize basic technical knowledge on Monero in one place.

MOM main objective is to contribute to the work made by [Monerodocs](https://monerodocs.org/) to have a complete guide on Monero Documentation. This is an independent source promoted by the [Monero Outreach Workgroup](https://www.monerooutreach.org/) to support [The Monero Project](https://github.com/monero-project) and have a complete guide for users around the world.
